		<h2 class="sub-heading"><u>Why I Made This Site</u></h2>
		<p class="paragraph">I made this website as when I was looking for a laptop, there was sites for gamers, students ect. But there wasn't a site made for programmers. So I figured i could make a website to help fellow coders out there to look for laptops. For now I will be including 5 computers. I also made his site because at the moment I am 13 years old (brithday 14th of October 2004) and when I am older I want to work at google, so this is gonna be used in the list of projects and work experience that I am gonna use to get that job. It is also to help me refine and practise all the code I learn as I have written all the code for this website independently and free handed. This site will have constant updates, changisng the appearance and design of the page. Not to mention the laptops changing as technology is for ever advancing it will go from 5th being the lowest (but still great) to 1st (being the best in my opinion). Just remember, if you don't agree with my rankings or choice don't start giving hate as this is all <strong>my opinion.</strong></p>

	    <p class="paragraph">The lenovo ideapad is a very powerful computer with high end spec for the price it is at. The hybrid storage could be a bit more on the ssd side and the hdd side should be a bit less but for the price... no complaints. This laptop will run most of your programs with a breeze. It's instant fingerprint reader allows quick and secure entry to the laptop. its low weight and sleek design also makes it ideal for programmers who are mobile, though the battery life isn't too great(3 hours 43 minutes).</p><br></br>

		<p class="paragraph">The Microsoft Surface Pro 4 is a great laptop overall. It will do most of your tasks. It's very slim design and low weight makes it the perfect laptop for mobile programmers. The 16 GB ram is perfect for running the coding programs you need. The Surface Pro 4 is also designed for art and modeling. With the surface pen you can design as much as you want. Though the pen has been pulled from the package with the laptop so you need to order it seperatly, and it is £100.</p><br></br>

		<p class="paragraph">This Laptop in Some programmers opinion is the best laptop for programming. The technology is cutting edge, the touch bar allows system customization easier, the operating system allows you to code for a variety of different platforms. with new technology with the fingerprint ID security is at it's best with the Macbook pro. the specs are all great but one of the only problems is the price. to get the good specs you need to spend alot of money, <strong>alot of money.</strong> Another probem is that you are limited to apple products with alot of things, such as the web browser being Safari (Apple web browser) and most of the apps on the laptop is Apple.</p><br></br>

		<p class="paragraph">The reason why this laptop was put above the <a href="#2">Macbook Pro</a> was because of my own preference. This laptop is the one I am using to code this laptop and the one I own now. So thats what I mean by "my own preference". But that is not all as this laptop is <strong>BEAST!</strong> It has close technology to the Macbook Pro but is a little cheaper. This laptop will be able to run all your programs. With my own experiences with this laptop it can code, game, design and if your student hold all your documents. It also automatically backs up all your saved personal files to your Onedrive account if you have and linked it. The design of the laptop is also beautiful like-wise to the Macbook pro. It's light weight and slim so you can take it anywhere you want. It's boot up speed is also swift.</p>
